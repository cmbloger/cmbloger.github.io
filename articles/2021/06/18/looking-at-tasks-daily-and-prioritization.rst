Looking at Tasks Daily and Prioritization
=========================================

.. tags: organization, time management

When looking for the next task to accomplish, what should we be paying
attention to?

Below we will use the Eisenhower matrix to align which task should be
done next.

The Eisenhower matrix involves labeling tasks as urgent and/or
important. Can we say that the importance or urgency of a task changes
in time? I would say obviously, yes. Does it require new information for
this state change to happen, or can a a task change state without new
information coming in? Perhaps it cannot, and when this question occurs,
it more that we aren't totally understanding the state of the task at
the forefront, we are misinformed, or we are being a bit careless with
the assignment of the task to the correct categories. Or, perhaps we
don't really have a task, we have a project, which needs to be split up.

General overview of the Eisenhower matrix procedure:

- List the applicable tasks
- Rate them in terms of urgency on a scale from 0 to 1
- Rate them in terms of importance on a scale from 0 to 1
- Do them in the following order:
  
  - Important and urgent
  - Important and not urgent
  - Not important and urgent
  - Not important and not urgent

In summary, the tasks are:
- 1,0 Create docs for work system, not needed in near term, important

- 1,0 Find optimal time for new threshold for alert pipeline, not needed in
  near term, important

- 1,1 Finish API key resolution with new app for info, is needed in near
  term

- 1,0 Update an operations tool for use for upgrades, not needed in near
  term

- 1,0 Create a new automated machine audit, not needed in near term

- 1,0 Create a module in the remediation system to handle direct device
  communication

- 1,0 Create script to make people's life easier by cleaning up their
  dashboard, not urgent, important

- 1,0 Create document to discuss networking side logic to drain and migrate
  VRRP devices, not urgent, is important

- 1,0 Learning more about programming technology to get better at it in
  general

- 0,0 Answering the question from a colleague that came in this morning
  regarding how automation is affecting his ticket queue
