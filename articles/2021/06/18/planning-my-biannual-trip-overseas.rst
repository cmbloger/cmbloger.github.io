Planning my Biannual Trip Overseas
==================================

.. tags: planning, organization, travel

There is some organization to do.

List of Important Data and Decisions
------------------------------------

- Need to get there 1.5h early, which is 12:10PM, and leaving home at
  11:50AM.

- Take off on Monday at 1:40PM

- Arrival time

  - 11h0m flight will be 12:40AM local time.
  - 1h30m layover will end at 2:10AM local time.
  - 1h5m flight to destination will end at 3:15AM local time.
  
  - This will be the quickest trip I've flown from home to this
    destination.

- Do I need to take off from work for this trip? 

  - Maybe the afternoon of the departure.

What do I need to do before I go? 
---------------------------------

I essentially have two full days where I can do things before I go, as I
don't want to be doing things the day that I fly out, especially since I
will be working that morning.

For each of these days, I need to save 12 hours to sleep and to do
personal maintenance.

Day 1
-----

- Add door jam reinforcement to a door that is missing the strike (4 hours)
  
  - Move things out of the way where it's easy to wipe things down after
    this work.

  - Mark the door jam where the large strike will be attached.

  - Mark where the lock will be mounted on the door, so that the large
    strike and the lock's hole can be drilled later and aligns with the
    large strike.

  - Close doors and the furnace to prevent the free flow of air from the
    work area into the living area in the house.

  - Sand the door jam down where the large strike will fit and the door
    will close without contacting the jam on any side.

  - Vacuum the immediate area so that we don't track dust elsewhere. 

  - Add the long hinge screws into the door and door jam.
  - Drill the door lock hole.
  - Vacuum.
  - Install all the metal parts.
  - Align the door by moving the large strike backward until the door seals.
  
  - Getting the metal strike in at the correct depth and tightness may require
    either cutting into the door stop to get the metal large strike
    under it a bit.

  - Vacuum and wipe everything down before placing everything back in the room.

- Finishing the front door (1 hour)
  
  - Sand down the foam seal on the front door so that it is the correct
    depth and the door closes smoothly afterward but still seals well

- Prepare luggage (2 hours, twice, because should do on Sunday too)

  - Wash and fold clothing and other things in the home
  - Check what has been pre-packed already and look for things missing

Day 2
-----

- Prepare luggage again as in day 1

- Put my personal files on a USB drive that I need to access from my
  work-issued computer

- (There is still room to add to Sunday.)
