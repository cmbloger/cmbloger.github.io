<p>2021-06-20</p>
<p>The last two times I went on this trip, these are the activities that I
did and the type of shoes that were needed:</p>

<p>In summary, I don’t think I have been on any events nicer than dinner at
someone’s house. And for that a pair of shoes that are clean is enough,
however the construction that I usually have to do includes doing real
damage to a pair of shoes.</p>
<p>I’m going to gamble and only take a pair of clean tennis shoes.</p>

<h3>What are the tasks that we are looking at?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-tasks-that-we-are-looking-at" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So I first listed the below list right here, but now I have pushed it
down and replace it with this paragraph. I did that because I wanted to
add importance and urgency (within context of the constraints).</p>

<p>It seems we don’t need to mark urgency, we only need to mark whether
it’s important to finish before the upcoming deadline. Actually, I’m not
convinced about how to measure urgency or even if I understand the
definition in light of this GTD technique.</p>

<p>2021-06-19</p>
<p>Tl; dr: In summary, for the destination country, we will pass on both
vaccination status and PCR test, independently. In summary, for the
transit, nothing needed for this transit.</p>
<p>Depending on one’s source country, when one gets off a trans-atlantic
flight right now, which is the end of COVID-19, one still has to have a
quarantine plan when destined for Europe.</p>
<section id="what-are-the-rules-right-now">
<h3>What are the rules right now?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-rules-right-now" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All travelers not from countries on a special list must register
online for a pre-travel clearance at the earliest, 72 hours before
entering your destination country.</p></li>
<li><p>Most travelers arriving from overseas are restricted entry to reduce
the spread of COVID-19, exceptions including citizens and persons
living in the same household, among other situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Any person who claims an exception must present either a certificate
of vaccination against COVID-19 meeting certain requirements; here
the requirements relating to vaccination:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inoculation with Pfizer, Moderna, and other vaccines mentioned on
the list</p></li>
<li><p>The traveler must be within a validity period of 3 months after
the first inoculation, or received 2 of 2 prescribed doses and
received the first dose of all prescribed doses less than 9
months prior to arrival.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If the requirements above cannot be met, then a negative COVID-19
test taken no earlier than 72 hours for PCR or 48 for antigen type AND
the person seeking entry must observe a 10-day quarantine at their
residence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also other exemptions to enter countries in Europe based on
life partner, or business, etc. And each country has its own rules. So
this is not an exhaustive list.</p>
<p>In summary, we will pass on both vaccination status and PCR test,
independently.</p>

<h3>What about travel through an airport in a 3rd country in Europe?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-about-travel-through-an-airport-in-a-3rd-country-in-europe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Looking at the information online I see that I can pass through by
changing flights without leaving the international transit area of the
airport as it does not constitute an entry into the transit country.
(Each country could be different.)</p>
<p>Specifically, digital entry registration, testing requirements,
quarantine requirements, etc., do not apply.</p>
<p>In summary, nothing needed for this transit.</p>

<h2><a class="reference external" href="2021/06/18/looking-at-tasks-daily-and-prioritization/">Looking at Tasks Daily and Prioritization</a><a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>2021-06-18</p>
<p>When looking for the next task to accomplish, what should we be paying
attention to?</p>
<p>Below we will use the Eisenhower matrix to align which task should be
done next.</p>
<p>The Eisenhower matrix involves labeling tasks as urgent and/or
important. Can we say that the importance or urgency of a task changes
in time? I would say obviously, yes. Does it require new information for
this state change to happen, or can a a task change state without new
information coming in? Perhaps it cannot, and when this question occurs,
it more that we aren’t totally understanding the state of the task at
the forefront, we are misinformed, or we are being a bit careless with
the assignment of the task to the correct categories. Or, perhaps we
don’t really have a task, we have a project, which needs to be split up.</p>
<p>General overview of the Eisenhower matrix procedure:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>List the applicable tasks</p></li>
<li><p>Rate them in terms of urgency on a scale from 0 to 1</p></li>
<li><p>Rate them in terms of importance on a scale from 0 to 1</p></li>
<li><p>Do them in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Important and urgent</p></li>
<li><p>Important and not urgent</p></li>
<li><p>Not important and urgent</p></li>
<li><p>Not important and not urgent</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the tasks are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1,0 Create docs for work system, not needed in near term, important</p></li>
<li><p>1,0 Find optimal time for new threshold for alert pipeline, not needed in
near term, important</p></li>
<li><p>1,1 Finish API key resolution with new app for info, is needed in near
term</p></li>
<li><p>1,0 Update an operations tool for use for upgrades, not needed in near
term</p></li>
<li><p>1,0 Create a new automated machine audit, not needed in near term</p></li>
<li><p>1,0 Create a module in the remediation system to handle direct device
communication</p></li>
<li><p>1,0 Create script to make people’s life easier by cleaning up their
dashboard, not urgent, important</p></li>
<li><p>1,0 Create document to discuss networking side logic to drain and migrate
VRRP devices, not urgent, is important</p></li>
<li><p>1,0 Learning more about programming technology to get better at it in
general</p></li>
<li><p>0,0 Answering the question from a colleague that came in this morning
regarding how automation is affecting his ticket queue</p></li>
