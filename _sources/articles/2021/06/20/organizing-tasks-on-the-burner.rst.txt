Organizing Tasks on the Burner
==============================

What are the tasks that we are looking at?
------------------------------------------

So I first listed the below list right here, but now I have pushed it
down and replace it with this paragraph. I did that because I wanted to
add importance and urgency (within context of the constraints).

What are the constraints we will apply importance and urgency within?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

It seems we don't need to mark urgency, we only need to mark whether
it's important to finish before the upcoming deadline. Actually, I'm not
convinced about how to measure urgency or even if I understand the
definition in light of this GTD technique.
