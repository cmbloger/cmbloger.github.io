Thinking About Which Shoes to Bring on a Trip
=============================================

The last two times I went on this trip, these are the activities that I
did and the type of shoes that were needed:

--------                   ---------------
Activity                   Instances
--------                   ---------------
Outdoor park               1
Outdoor construction work  20+
Exercising (running)       1
Dinner at someone's home   1
Casual dining              1
Fine dining                0
--------                   ---------------


--------                   ---------------
Activity                   Instances
--------                   ---------------
Outdoor park               2
Outdoor construction work  0
Exercising (running)       0
Dinner at someone's home   1
Casual dining              1
Fine dining                0
--------                   ---------------

In summary, I don't think I have been on any events nicer than dinner at
someone's house. And for that a pair of shoes that are clean is enough,
however the construction that I usually have to do includes doing real
damage to a pair of shoes.

I'm going to gamble and only take a pair of clean tennis shoes.
