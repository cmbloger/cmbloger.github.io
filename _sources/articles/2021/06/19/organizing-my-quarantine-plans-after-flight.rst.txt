Organizing my Quarantine Plans after Flight
===========================================

.. tags: COVID-19

Tl; dr: In summary, for the destination country, we will pass on both
vaccination status and PCR test, independently. In summary, for the
transit, nothing needed for this transit.

Depending on one's source country, when one gets off a trans-atlantic
flight right now, which is the end of COVID-19, one still has to have a
quarantine plan when destined for Europe.


What are the rules right now?
-----------------------------

- All travelers not from countries on a special list must register
  online for a pre-travel clearance at the earliest, 72 hours before
  entering your destination country.

- Most travelers arriving from overseas are restricted entry to reduce
  the spread of COVID-19, exceptions including citizens and persons
  living in the same household, among other situations.

- Any person who claims an exception must present either a certificate
  of vaccination against COVID-19 meeting certain requirements; here
  the requirements relating to vaccination:
    
  - Inoculation with Pfizer, Moderna, and other vaccines mentioned on
    the list
    
  - The traveler must be within a validity period of 3 months after
    the first inoculation, or received 2 of 2 prescribed doses and
    received the first dose of all prescribed doses less than 9
    months prior to arrival.

- If the requirements above cannot be met, then a negative COVID-19
  test taken no earlier than 72 hours for PCR or 48 for antigen type AND
  the person seeking entry must observe a 10-day quarantine at their
  residence.

There are also other exemptions to enter countries in Europe based on
life partner, or business, etc. And each country has its own rules. So
this is not an exhaustive list.

In summary, we will pass on both vaccination status and PCR test,
independently.


What about travel through an airport in a 3rd country in Europe?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Looking at the information online I see that I can pass through by
changing flights without leaving the international transit area of the
airport as it does not constitute an entry into the transit country.
(Each country could be different.) 

Specifically, digital entry registration, testing requirements,
quarantine requirements, etc., do not apply.

In summary, nothing needed for this transit.
