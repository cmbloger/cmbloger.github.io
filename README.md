How to post.
in unprocessed/ create blog articles with yyyy-mm-dd_ to start the 
file name, then the rest as the slug.

Make will run and sort the files in the correct directory structure in source, which will get picked up in the next part.

The github actions will create the gh-pages diff.

The preprocessing gets the content from human-created to sphinx-readable.

Then sphinx runs as normal.
